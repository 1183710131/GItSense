Below are several prompts we have tried. We refer to previous works on the usage of prompts. 
For each prompt, we conduct small-scale experiments with both "skip/ not skip" and "passed/failed" responses. 
Finally, based on F1-score, we choose the first two for the final experiment.


1: In continuous integration, there are some builds can be skipped. Now I will give you a build with some texts and features and you need to determine if this build can be skipped. You cannot give vague answers. Your answer must be either skip or not skip, it cannot be anything else. The features are: {}. The texts are: {}.
2: In continuous integration, there are some builds can be skipped. Now I will give you a build with some texts and you need to determine if this build can be skipped. You cannot give vague answers. Your answer must be either skip or not skip, it cannot be anything else. The texts are: {}.
3: Considering that some builds in continuous integration are passed and others failed during the build process. Next, I will give you some build examples, please help me predict which ones are passed and which ones are failed. You cannot give vague answers. Your answer must be either passed or failed, it cannot be anything else. A build includes some texts and features. The features are: {}. The texts are: {}.
